# Recursion

This project highlights the usefulness of using recursive methods in programming.
I was tasked with two separate assignments to practice my understanding of the topic:

1. Write two functions which both display an array of numbers containing an input amount of fibonacci sequence integers.

The first function must use for loop incrementation and the second function must use recursion.
Shown in the file fibonacci.js, my functions are proven with an identical logging of the first 25 integers in the sequence when the file is run.

2. Construct the merge sort algorithm which takes an unordered array of numbers and outputs an array with the same sorted numbers.

Using recursion once again, I was able to construct the merge sort algorithm as shown in the file mergeSort.js.
My algorithm is proven by logging a sorted array of 100 random numbers in the range of 0 to 1000 when the file is run.
